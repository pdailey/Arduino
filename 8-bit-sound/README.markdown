# The 8 Bit Music Box


The circuit is easy to build, message me if you need clarification.

## Why?
This project started with a desire to implement clean rotary encoder code. Add an LED bar, headphone jacks, and a few potentiometers, and suddenly the only option was to create a music box. Along the way, I also picked up some experience in memory management with pointers to arrays, ternary operators, and finite state machines.

## TODO
- Automatically set the tempo for each song
